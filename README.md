# NgxCauldron

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.1.

## Purpose
This projects is a cauldron of many Angular Features, it must not be used as a dependency but it can be used for training or trying new features all together.
All the features are designed in order to be compatible with each other.

It also takes inspiration from other libraries which are not included as dependencies for many reasons (they could be not-compatible or I may not like the way they're written!)

See the project's homepage to have a list of all the features.

[Work in progress]
